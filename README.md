# Machine Learning API Service 

Machine Learning Prediction Algorithm made with Python's FastAPI and built with Docker
This repo contains the source code you can containerize using modern cloud with k8s or any container orcastrator. 
Focus on your ml work and use this cookie cutter to create an API image for deployment to have a prediction modeling service.

## Notes
Use kaniko. Ditch docker.
